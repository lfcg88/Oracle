Legato Storage Manager (LSM) Enabler and Authorization Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is an LSM Enabler Code?

  An LSM Enabler Code is a temporary code enabling Legato Networker evaluation.

What is an LSM Authorization code?

  An LSM Authorization Code is a permanent Enabler Code. It is installed over
  the top of the base enabler code. 

What is LSM installed with?

  LSM is installed with the permanent authorization code (it never expires).

How can I tell the Enabler Code that I have installed?

  1. Use the nwadmin LSM GUI by pulling down the following menus:
       Server->Registration

  2. The displayed screen should show the following details:
       Registration: Legato Storage Manager
       Name: Legato Storage Manager
       Enabler Code: fa577c-a16e3f-d26553
       Host id: <some number>
       Expiration date: Authorized - No expiration date

When can these codes cause a problem?

  They shouldn't! LSM, when installed from the Oracle distribution, should
  come automatically configured with the correct Enabler Code and the nwadmin
  GUI should show the information above.

But what if they DO cause a problem?

  It is possible that in certain circumstances (for example, after media loss 
  and subsequent disaster recovery, or if you manually move your LSM 
  installation) you may lose your permanent Enabler Code. In this case you may
  see 'Legato Evaluation' (or something similar) in the Registration field. In
  this case, perform the following steps to re-enter the permanent Enabler Code:

  1. nwadmin->Server->Registration
  2. Click 'create'
  3. Enter the following in the Enabler code: field
       fa577c-a16e3f-d26553
  4. Click 'apply'
  
  The Legato Evaluation should now be replaced with the LSM registration.
