select profile from DBA_USERS where username = '<username>';
Then you can change the limit to never expire using:

alter profile <profile_name> limit password_life_time UNLIMITED;
If you want to previously check the limit you may use:

select resource_name,limit from dba_profiles where profile='<profile_name>';
