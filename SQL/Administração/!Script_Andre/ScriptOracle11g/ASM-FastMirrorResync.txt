Here’s an example that shows how to specify ASM fast mirror resync for a disk group:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL> alter diskgroup dgroupA
set attribute 'disk_repair_time'='2h';

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can also enable fast mirror resync by setting more complex time duration, as shown here:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL> alter diskgroup dgroupA
set attribute 'disk_repair_time'="2D6H30M";


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once you repair a disk, you bring it online using the following command:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL> alter diskgroup dgroupA online;


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can override the time defined at the disk group level by specifying the drop after clause in an alter diskgroup <diskgroup_name> offline . . .
command, as shown here:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL> alter diskgroup dgroupA
offline disks in failuregroup controller1
drop after 4h;

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This command requires the database to wait for two hours before bringing the disk group dgroupA online again.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL> alter diskgroup dgroupA
online disks in failuregroup controller1 power 2 wait;


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you can’t repair an offline disk group, you can use the force option to drop the disk group, as shown here:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SQL> alter diskgroup dgroupA
drop disks in failuregroup controller1 force;


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can monitor the fast mirror resync process using
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

select * from V$ASM_DISK ;
select * from V$ASM_DISK_IOSTAT views;

seçect * from V$ASM_OPERATION where OPERATION='sync'
