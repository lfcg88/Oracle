You can investigate any outstanding problems in the database by directly going tothe Support Workbench homepage. However, the best way to access the Support
Workbench is to first check if there are any outstanding critical alerts in the database.
To do this, go to the Database Home page in Enterprise Manager and scroll down to the Diagnostic Summary section, where you’ll see the Active Incidents link.

You
can also click on the Critical Alert link in the Alerts section if you want, to go to
the Support Workbench.
