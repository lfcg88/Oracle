The following exercise shows how to use the SQL Tuning Advisor to get
recommendations for fixing a SQL statement to improve its performance.


In this example, use the ADDM finding with the highest impact as the source of the
SQL statement that you want the SQL Tuning Advisor to tune. Here are the steps:

1. On the Database Home page, click the finding with the highest impact on
database time.
2. The SQL Details page appears. Click Schedule SQL Tuning Advisor.
3. Click Submit on the Scheduler Advisor page that appears.
4. When the advisor task is completed, the database displays the recommendations.
Click Implement if you want to adopt the recommendations.
5. Click Yes on the Confirmation page. This will create a new SQL profile to
improve the performance of the statement that the advisor is tuning.
6. Once you implement the SQL Profile that the advisor recommends, access
the Performance page after the database executes the tuned SQL statement
the next time, to view the benefits of the tuning.


You can view information about the recent runs of the Automatic SQL Tuning
task by going to the Automated Maintenance Tasks page. On the Database Control
home page, click the Server tab. Under the Tasks section in the Server page, click
the Automated Maintenance Tasks link. You’ll see all predefined tasks on the
Automated Maintenance Tasks page. Click either the Automatic SQL Tuning task
or the most recent execution icon to get to the Automatic SQL Tuning Result
Summary page.
