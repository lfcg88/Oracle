You can configure various Automatic SQL Tuning task parameters easily by using the
Enterprise Manager. To configure using Database Control, you use the Automatic SQL
Tuning Settings page, which you can access by clicking the Configure button on the
Automated Maintenance tasks page. This takes you to the Automated Maintenance
Tasks Configuration page, where you’ll see all the predefined maintenance windows.
SQL Tuning Advisor will run in all these predefined maintenance windows by default,
but you can disable it from any window you like. You can click the Edit Window Group
button to edit the windows.
You can specify all the Automatic SQL Tuning parameters just discussed on the
Automatic SQL Tuning Settings page. Note that by default, automatic implementation
of SQL profiles is deactivated.
