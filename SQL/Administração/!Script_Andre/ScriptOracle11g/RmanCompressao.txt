shows the differences between the two compression algorithms you can choose from:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL> select algorithm_name,algorithm_description, is_default
2 from v$rman_compression_algorithm;


ALGORITHM 	ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION 				IS_DEFAULT
--------- 	---------------------------------------- ---------
ZLIB 		fast but little worse compression ratio 	YES
BZIP2 		good compression ratio but little slower 	NO

You can choose the configuration algorithm you want to use by executing the configure
command, as shown here:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


RMAN> configure compression algorithm 'bzip2';
new RMAN configuration parameters:
CONFIGURE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM 'bzip2';
new RMAN configuration parameters are successfully stored
