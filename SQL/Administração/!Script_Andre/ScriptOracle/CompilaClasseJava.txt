How to find a jar file which contains a particular JAVA CLASS object 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1) Find invalid java classes: 
-------------------------- 
Lets assume that we have two JAVA CLASS invalids as returned by the 
following query: 
SQL>SELECT object_name,object_type,owner,status FROM dba_objects 
WHERE object_type='JAVA CLASS' AND status='INVALID'; 
OBJECT_NAME OBJECT_TYPE OWNER STATUS 
------------------------------ ----------- ------- ------- 
/b0993e19_MyAppsContext JAVA CLASS APPS INVALID 
oracle/apps/fnd/common/FileLog JAVA CLASS APPS INVALID 
2) Try to resolve invalids: 
------------------------ 
First of all try to resolve these invalids using following statements. 
SQL>ALTER JAVA CLASS "/b0993e19_MyAppsContext" RESOLVE; 
SQL> ALTER JAVA CLASS "oracle/apps/fnd/common/FileLog" RESOLVE; 
Note: If you don't include java class name in double quotes the statements will fail. 
If these objects are still invalid proceed to next step 
3) Find respective modules of java classes: 
---------------------------------------- 
We need to check as to which module the JAVA CLASS belongs. 
To check the module of first invalid run the following statement: 
SQL>SELECT dbms_java.longname('/b0993e19_MyAppsContext') FROM dual; 
DBMS_JAVA.LONGNAME('/B0993E19_MYAPPSCONTEXT') 
--------------------------------------------------- 
oracle/apps/wms/cartonization/server/MyAppsContext 
The result of this query shows that this java class is associated 
with WMS module as it is included in oracle/apps/wms package 
From the name of second invalid above, FileLog, it is clear that it is 
associated with FND module as it is included in oracle/apps/fnd package. 
4) Find jar file which includes the java class: 
-------------------------------------------- 
Create a shell script, say, whichjar.sh with the following logic: 
#!/usr/bin/ksh 
for f in `ls $1/java/jar/*.jar` 
do 
t=`strings $f | grep $2` 
if test ! -z "$t" 
then 
echo "$2 is found in $f" 
fi 
done 
Now run the script with the following command: 
$./whichjava.sh <$PRODUCT_TOP> <CLASSNAME> 
$./whichjar.sh $WMS_TOP MyAppsContext 
MyAppsContext is found in /u01/visappl/wms/11.5.0/java/jar/wmscrtzn.jar 
$./whichjar.sh $FND_TOP FileLog 
FileLog is found in /u01/visappl/fnd/11.5.0/java/jar/fndaolj.jar 
Note: Before running the script make sure you give execute permissions 
to script and there are no control or junk characters in the script 
5) Load jar file into database: 
---------------------------- 
Change directory to [8.1.7 ORACLE_HOME]\bin and run the following command: 
$loadjava -force -verbose -resolve \ 
-user apps/<apps_pwd>@<connect_string> $WMS_TOP/java/jar/wmscrtzn.jar 
$loadjava -force -resolve \ 
-user apps/<apps_pwd>@<connect_string> $FND_TOP/java/jar/fndaolj.jar
