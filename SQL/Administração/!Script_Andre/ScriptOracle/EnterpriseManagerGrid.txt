When a session is waiting on read by other session, an entry will be seen in the v$session_wait system view giving more information on the blocks being waited for:

Code:
SELECT p1 "file#", p2 "block#", p3 "class#"
FROM v$session_wait
WHERE event = 'read by other session';



If information collected from the above query repeatedly shows that the same block (or range of blocks) is experiencing waits and the class of the block is of type “data block” (which usually is), this indicates a “hot” block or object.

The following query will give the name and type of the object:

Code:
SELECT relative_fno, owner, segment_name, segment_type
FROM dba_extents
WHERE file_id = &file
AND &block BETWEEN block_id AND block_id + blocks - 1




SELECT a.relative_fno, a.owner, a.segment_name, a.segment_type
FROM dba_extents a
WHERE a.file_id = &file
AND &block BETWEEN a.block_id AND a.block_id + a.blocks - 1

FROM dba_extents a
WHERE a.file_id = 9
AND  2621306 BETWEEN a.block_id AND a.block_id + a.blocks - 1
