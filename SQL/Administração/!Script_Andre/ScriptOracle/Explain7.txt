Explain 7 - A framework for running explain plan against Oracle 7.3



The following script is one that I use regularly when checking execution paths 
in Oracle 7.3. There is Oracle 8 version that I use when reviewing when checking 
Oracle 8 queries that use partition tables.
The code allows many users to depend on the same plan_table, whilst guaranteeing 
that they do not collide (by using the session's audit id to tag the plan) and 
guaranteeing that the plan_table always appears to be empty (by issuing a 
rollback after the report has completed)

rem
rem	Script:		explain7.sql
rem	Author:		Jonathan Lewis
rem	Purpose:	q and d to execute explain plan (Oracle 7.3)
rem
rem	Preparation:
rem		Run $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlxplan.sql as SYSTEM
rem		Create public synonym plan_table for plan_table
rem		Grant all on plan_table to public
rem		Create an index (id,parent_id) on plan_table
rem
rem	Use:
rem		Put the guilty SQL statement (with ';') into a file called
rem			target.sql
rem		Start explain7.sql
rem
rem		The script displays the current audit id, then
rem		the execution path, simultaneously writing the
rem		execution path to a file identified by the audit id.
rem
rem	Suggestions:
rem		Adjust termout on/off to taste
rem		Adjust pagesize to taste
rem		Adjust linesize to taste
rem		set pause on/off to taste
rem	

set pagesize 24
set linesize 180
set trimspool on
set verify off
