There are several system views that can provide us with information reguarding archives, such as: 


V$DATABASE 
Identifies whether the database is in ARCHIVELOG or NOARCHIVELOG mode and whether MANUAL (archiving mode) has been specified. 
V$ARCHIVED_LOG 
Displays historical archived log information from the control file. If you use a recovery catalog, the RC_ARCHIVED_LOG view contains similar information. 
V$ARCHIVE_DEST 
Describes the current instance, all archive destinations, and the current value, mode, and status of these destinations. 
V$ARCHIVE_PROCESSES 
Displays information about the state of the various archive processes for an instance. 
V$BACKUP_REDOLOG 
Contains information about any backups of archived logs. If you use a recovery catalog, the RC_BACKUP_REDOLOG contains similar information. 
V$LOG 
Displays all redo log groups for the database and indicates which need to be archived. 
V$LOG_HISTORY 
Contains log history information such as which logs have been archived and the SCN range for each archived log. 
Using these tables we can verify that we are infact in ARCHIVELOG mode:
